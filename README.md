# Vagrant Environment Builds

This will be a repository of all the different [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) builds I use for development with different programming languages. See the README.md files inside the folders for more details about the specific builds and what was involved with creating them. 

### Folder Descriptions

1. **precise32-base-upgrade && precise64-base-upgrade**
    
    These folders contain the details and files used in creating the upgraded base builds of Vagrant's Ubuntu Precise boxes. Check the README.md files for details on how to use the packaged builds of the boxes that are available on cdn.jlwestsr.com.
